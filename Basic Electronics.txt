2 types of components:
passive// stores energy in the form of voltage or current
cannot control flow of current
cannot provide any current gain to circuit
Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Transformees

Active//generate energy inthe form of voltage and current
supply energy and can control flow of current
they can provide current gain to the circuit
Transistors,triode,vacuum tubes, Voltage sources


Circuit
Electrical : Closed loop giving return path for current

electronics:Amplification computation and data transfer
Analog:m uses continous signals
digital: discrete signals

2 types// Series and parellel
in series current same , in parellel voltages same
Closed circuit and open circuit


Current:flow of electric charge

What is the difference between Electronics and Electrical
//Electronics work on DC and with a voltage range of -48vDC to +48vDC
Electric devices use line voltage (120vAC, 240vAC, etc...).

What is communication
//Communication means transferring a signal from the transmitter which passes through a medium then the output is obtained at the receiver.

What is diode
//unidirectional current property
two-terminal device

What is transistor
//transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals

What is sampling
//The process of obtaining a set of samples from a continuous function of time x(t) is referred to as sampling

State sampling theorem
//while taking the samples of a continuous signal, it has to be taken care that the sampling rate is equal to or greater than twice the cut off frequency and the minimum sampling rate is known as the Nyquist rate.

advantages of resistors
//Resistors are very small in size
Resistors are very cheap

cutoff frequency
//The cutoff frequency or corner frequency of an electronic circuit is the frequency at which the output signal of the system starts reducing

Passband
//Passband is the range of frequencies or wavelengths that can pass through a filter without being attenuated

Stop band
//
