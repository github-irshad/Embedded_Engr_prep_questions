2 types of components:
passive// stores energy in the form of voltage or current
cannot control flow of current
cannot provide any current gain to circuit
Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Transformees

Active//generate energy inthe form of voltage and current
supply energy and can control flow of current
they can provide current gain to the circuit
Transistors,triode,vacuum tubes, Voltage sources


Circuit
Electrical : Closed loop giving return path for current

electronics:Amplification computation and data transfer
Analog:m uses continous signals
digital: discrete signals

2 types// Series and parellel
in series current same , in parellel voltages same
Closed circuit and open circuit


Current:flow of electric charge
